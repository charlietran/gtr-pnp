Glory to Rome Print & Play

Instructions I used for printplaygames.com, October 2023:

### Cards
Images generated from https://gtr.stormtide.net. Each file contains images for 18 cards, and some files have blank spots since you can only print in multiples of 18.

Included are card sets both with and without the fan-made promo expansion.

- Printplaygames Item: [2.5" x 3.5" Poker Cards](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/poker-cards). 
- Options: Print Double Sided, Gloss (cheapest, you can pay more for nicer cards but I sleeved them anyway)
- **Order Cards**: 3x each of the OrderCards_*.png files, with OrderCardBack.png as back
  - 159 Order cards and 3 blank without promo, 195 Order cards and 21 blank with promo
- **Site Cards**: 2x each of SiteFront.png, with SiteBack.png as back
  - 72 Site cards
- **Misc Cards**: 1x of MiscFront.png, with MiscBack.png as back
  - 3 Leader cards (you only need one, so two extra), 6 Merchant Bonus Cards, 6 Jack Cards, 3 blank

### Player Boards
I got these [redesigned player boards](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215385/glory-rome-camp-player-aid) from BGG user BlueBirthNorth. 

The originals are designed to be printed at 9.16"x5.17" and cut down to 8.25"x4.25". I resized and adjusted the design to be printed out at 9"x5" and cut down to 8"x4.25" to fit my intended box.

- Printplaygames Item: [Any Size Custom Single Piece Board](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/board-custom-any-size-single-piece/). 
- Options: Small Board (up to 8" x 10.5"), Print One Side, Width: 9, Height: 5
- Special Instructions: Print is at 9"x5" but please cut down to 8"x4.25" based on corner cut lines
